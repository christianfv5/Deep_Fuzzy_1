# 2019 Research

This repository contains a collection of python code and jupyter notebooks I wrote during my work term as a research assistant at the University of Alberta under the supervision of Dr. Scott Dick.

The purpose of the research is to investigate the efficacy of a novel type of neural network that combines deep learning and fuzzy logic. The goal is to create a system that combines the classification power of deep convolutional neural networks and the interpretability of adaptive neuro-fuzzy systems.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Jupyter Notebook
* Keras
* TensorFlow
* SciKit-Learn
* SciKit-Fuzzy
* UMAP-Learn
* possibly more?

The easiest way to install all of the dependencies is to use a conda environment. Installing umap-learn using conda-forge will change the NumPy version and possibly cause issues with TensorFlow.
