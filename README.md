# Deep Convolutional Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System

This repository contains the source code for the *Deep Convolutional
Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System* paper I co-authored with Mojtaba
Yeganejou and Dr. Scott Dick.

The paper investigates a new type of neural network that utilizes
neuro-fuzzy systems to create more interpretable models. Conventional
neural network layers are used for feature extraction, and a
neuro-fuzzy classifier to output the class probabilities.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Jupyter Notebook
* Keras
* TensorFlow
* NumPy
* SciKit-Learn
* SciKit-Fuzzy
* UMAP-Learn
* H5Py
* iNNvestigate

The majority of the code is written in Jupyter Notebooks to make
sharing results and the corresponding code easier.

## Relevant Code

The has been uploaded in the state it was written and therefore is
unorganized. The purpose of this section is to point out parts of the
code most relevant the paper.
